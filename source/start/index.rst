=====================

Virtual Archives are online archives that provide an easy access to Earth Observation data by coupling high bandwidth, large storage space and software.
It is a Cloud solution providing Storage-as-a-Service for storing the data and is coupled with complementary services:

1) Data discovery implementing simple interfaces such as OpenSearch and results in Atom, RDF and KML format
2) Data access via common web protocols such as HTTP(s)

The virtual archive technical solution is based on research and development performed by Terradue and partially funded by European Commission Framework Programme 7 on the context of the GENESI-DEC and GEOWOW projects.
